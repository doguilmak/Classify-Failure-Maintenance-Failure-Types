
# Classify Failure Types with XGBoost and ANN


## Problem Statement

Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain and in particular difficult to publish, we present and provide a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in the industry to the best of our knowledge.

The purpose of this study is based on the data, I want to classity and estimate maintenance failure types with XGBoost and artificial neural network. Output layer has 6 units. These are **No Failure, Heat Dissipation Failure, Power Failure, Overstrain Failure, Tool Wear Failure, Random Failures.**

## Dataset

Datasets are downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification). You can find the details of the datasets in that website. **predictive_maintenance.csv** dataset has **10 columns** and **10000 rows without the header**. **Independent variables has 6 columns** (ID and Product_ID columnd dropped) and **depended variable has 1 column** which is Power Failure. 

| Column | Details |
|--|--|
| UID  | unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10000 |
| Product_ID | Consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%) and high (20%) as product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number |
| Air_temperature_[K] | generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K |
| Process_temperature_[K] | generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K. |
| Rotational_speed_[rpm] | calculated from powepower of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise |
| Torque_[Nm] | torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with an Ïƒ = 10 Nm and no negative values. |
| Tool_wear_[min] | The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process. |
| Failure_Type | No Failure, Heat Dissipation Failure, Power Failure, Overstrain Failure, Tool Wear Failure, Random Failures. |

## Methodology

In this project, as stated in the title, results were obtained through **XGBoost** and **artificial neural networks** methods. Our output has more than 1 units so I used ***sparse_categorical_crossentropy*** loss function.

### Artificial Neural Network

The keras model was created as indicated in the image above. Since the model output is binary, the **sparse_categorical_crossentropy** loss function is used. The model is saved as **model.h5**. When necessary, you can operate this model without the need for re-fit.

During the fit of the model, the validation probability and the validation loss graph were formed as follows.

| Validaton Accuracy | Validation Loss |
|--|--|
| ![val_acc](Plots/model_acc.png) | ![val_loss](Plots/model_loss.png) |

### XGBoost
